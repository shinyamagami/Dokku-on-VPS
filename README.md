# Fly.io is much cheaper than any VPS below
But we need to bring managed database from somewhere if we don't want to pay.

# AWS LightSail to DigitalOcean

The reason I decided to move from LightSail to DigitalOcean is Dokku tells me to use root, which LightSail does not allow me to.
While DigitalOcean does, the cheapest VPS from it is $4 for 1 CPU, 512MB, and meager 10GB SSD. The cheapest one from LightSail offers
a $5 plan for 2! CPU, 512MB, and 20GB SSD, whose half is already used from the beginning.

# AWS LightSail to Akamai Linode

I happened to learn that 10GB was too small for Dokku so that I would have to use, at least, $6 plan on DigitalOcean.
It changed my mind, and I decided to use Linode, which offers $5 plan with 25GB SSD. Linode is now owned by Akamai.

It seems that we have to install dokku under root. I installed it under an user I created and I couldn't not deploy
an application. 


When you want to seed with the seed file,
dokku run rails7-sample bundle exec rake db:migrate db:seed


# Useful Commands for Dokku

When Dokku adds unnecesary docker images, disk usage goes full

This lists docker images.  
`sudo docker image ls`

This gets rid of unused docker images.  
`sudo docker system prune -a`

Connect to database  
`dokku postgres:connect dbname`  
We can also edit database with `rails c` if necessary.


# Object storage for assets

Most people use external service for Active Storage. AWS S3 is the most popular choice because it started early.
CloudFlare R2 is a new kid on the block and more affordable. I haven't used it yet but seems simpler to use.
We can utilize CDN and object storage from CloudFlare as an one stop solution. Sounds good.
